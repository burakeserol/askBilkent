				p I was kind of a Java-holic. I wanted to learn more about arrays in C. Is there such an array: int test[5][5][5] I want to know how many integer elements it has. I had three questions: I think there are 125 int type elements. Is that correct?Is it correct that test has 125 *int type elements?Is it correct that test has 5 **int type elements?

				p Firstly, i think there are 125 int type elements.That's right. It's an array of 5 arrays of 5 arrays of 5 ints, which means there's a total of 125 ints.secondly, is it correct that above 'test' array has 125 *int type elements?*int is not a valid type - presumably you mean int*. Either way, the answer is no. There are no pointers here.thirdly, is it correct that the 'test' array has 5 **int type elements?Again, **int is probably meant to be int**, but the answer is no. No pointers in this declaration.Presumably you're asking this because you have some idea that "arrays are pointers" or "arrays are just pointers under the hood" - this idea is wrong. When you ask for an int[5][5][5], you get exactly that - a 3-dimensional array consisting of a total of 125 int objects.

				p Only the first statement is correct. And you also have another guarantee: multi-dimensional arrays in C++ (notice that C and C++ are two different languages) allocate contiguous memory blocks
